    "# Simple Epidemic Model of H5N1 Spillover from Cows\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of a multi-population/species model inspired by the ongoing (as of Spring 2024) outbreak of H5N1 in cows. The basic idea is to have an ongoing outbreak in cattle where there is migration/movement between farms. The model also has population of farm workers who can be directly (if rarely) infected from cattle and may spread it within itself, and a general population that can be infected from the farmworkers and spread it within itself.

    "To keep things simple we will create a population with 3 locations to start. Each location is assumed to contain some sort of dairy operation with farm workers and a connected general population. To represent this we will have a `Location` column with a location number, a `Population` model that can take on values `cow`, `farm_workers`, or `gen_pop` (general population). Each of these populations will have an infection state (`InfState`) which takes on the typical values of `S`, `I` and `R`. \n",
